## Grades

### Following TDD principles

B

Much improved effort. Definitely a solid B grade. I feel as though the iterative development and improvement
is clear in this exercise.

One area to improve is the refactoring including making sure we're trying to incrementally improve. It does feel
like you did a huge amount of refactoring quite late on, which would have saved you time earlier.

### Pass Rate

A

Solid attempt. Be careful with the way in which you approach the tests.

### White box analysis

B

Very good attempt. Very clear to understand. But aside from clarity it breaks pretty much all linting rules
and organisational aims.

Essentially you did the hard bit well, and the easy bit you didn't do!

### Miscellaneous Criteria

C

It does feel still a bit chaotic. But there is definite improvement. I do feel as though a bit like the white-box
analysis, you have done some of the hard parts well, but then missed out on some of the easy marks.

### Overall Grade

B

A very solid B grade. I think the next steps to get towards the A are just to make sure you're being a bit
clearer, and avoiding the small mistakes.
