# Report Grade - LCD

Report for Nazar, for the LCD project

## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **35%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor for the suggested steps provided in the README?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor once it came to the stretch goals?
* Pass Rate - **15%**
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
  * Did you pass the `lcd_numbers_spec.rb` in its entirety?
  * Did you pass all tests?
* White box analysis - **45%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed **all** redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **5%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

C

Whilst there is a little bit of iteration. Tracking your thought process is quite difficult

You have made a good habit of doing small and frequent commits, the next step is to articulate them better
stating "X was done", or "Y has been fixed"

### Pass Rate - 0

F

No tests pass. Check the implementation details. You've left in a lot of debug code

### White box analysis

D

It is hard to grade this given you haven't achieved much of the requirements

You have got one very large method, which is counter-intuitive to the purpose of coding. We don't want
machine-code, we want nice elegant methods we can traverse, read and debug

You've got lots of redundant code and opportunities to optimise the code, as such it really needs some good TLC

### Miscellaneous Criteria

D

Tracking your git commits is becoming harder and more complex

Lots of the messages make little to no sense

### Overall Grade

D

Because the exercise was only partially complete, I expected to see something half-polished

However the way you've attempted to solve this is again wrong. You need to remember the purpose of iterative
TDD. I am expecting you to solve something that works for 1 test, and then improve on it. Instead you had
something that possibly worked in some situations and now it works in none
