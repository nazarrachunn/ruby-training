## Grades

### Following TDD principles

A

You did iterate, do the bare minimum each time and do red-green-refactor

### Pass Rate

A

All tests pass

### White box analysis

A

Your code is neat, but there are a couple of minor things to improve.

- `name` was a better parameter name
- random whitespace

### Miscellaneous Criteria

C

Your git commit history isn't very good, it still needs some work

### Overall Grade

A

A very good project to finish on!
