# Site Prism

This is a framework that allows you to create POM (Page Object Model), objects. Once you have done this, you
can use these objects to query web pages using a nice clean semantic DSL (Domain Specific Language).

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ gem install bundler # if you don't have it already
$ bundle
```

## Working through the examples

To run the examples, you just need to run (for example):

```
$ ruby example_1.rb
```

## How this will work

Each time we write some new code, we need to try observe what the code is doing, and see if we can
learn a little whilst doing it. The exercises will be provided with the boilerplate code already
written, so much isn't required from the user.
