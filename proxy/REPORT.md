# Report Grade - Proxy

Report for Nazar, for the Proxy project

## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **25%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor?
* Pass Rate - **40%**
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
  * Were you able to create the proxy? (Spec #1)
  * Can you proxy all standard methods? (Specs #2/#3)
  * Were you able to differentiate between methods that should/shouldn't be proxied? (Spec #4)
  * Were you able to enhance your proxy to perform some logging? (Specs #5-#10)
* White box analysis - **25%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed **all** redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **10%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)
  * Did not amend any of the prohibited files

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

C

Quite a bit of the code has been slung together simultaneously, making incremental changes almost impossible
to detect (If they were done)

The iteration isn't great, but I can see some evolution

There is quite a lot of missed opportunities for red-green-refactors

### Pass Rate

A

All tests pass

### White box analysis

D

Quite a lot of redundant code

Some erroneous code for overridden methods

### Miscellaneous Criteria

C

Git was reasonably easy to follow, but there was lots of commits that didn't add up

### Overall Grade

B

You literally just scraped a B, which I think is a generous grade.

Here passing the tests was good, but other than that, there were quite a lot of errors - these need to be
ironed out in the coming week/s to show you are able to work on a shared codebase
