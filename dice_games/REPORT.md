# Report Grade - Dice Games

Report for Nazar, for the Dice Games project

## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **30%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor?
* Pass Rate - **30%**
  * Did your code pass when I ran it?
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis - **30%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed all redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **10%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)
  * Did you manage to refactor the test on `spec/dice_spec.rb:41`

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

C

Whilst there are several commits and PR's. There is nothing in the way of iteration of red-green refactoring.

Some concept of writing the minimum code was done across both exercises, but again no real improvement can be seen.

### Pass Rate

B

Whilst all the tests do indeed pass. Quite a few of the conditions are not true, and pass by mistake.

Some of the conditions also are very obscure and as such it's hard to tell exactly "why" they pass.

Some of the rules of greed haven't been adhered to.

### White box analysis

D

Linting score would be off-the-chart for some of the metrics inside the greed class.

Overall basic visual linting also isn't great. The reading of your class for greed is also very complicated.

Remember during the red-green-refactor techniques you should be trying to iteratively refactor things. Something I
think you have probably missed during the exercise.

### Miscellaneous Criteria

E

Commit history is very hard to follow, but there is a history.

Spec file was not refactored

### Overall Grade

C

Not a bad attempt, but I am concerned as the problem got bigger you stopped following the same guides and tips
to improve on how you write your code. Please try follow the exercise aims / rules to ensure you're completing
the project/s as intended.
